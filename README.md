# Mefy's Freeze-Tag map descriptions

This repository contains map descriptions for use with Mefy's Freeze-Tag mod for
Medal of Honor Allied Assault (and the Spearhead and Breakthrough expansions).

To use these, download the [latest
release](https://github.com/DvdGiessen/mefy-freezetag-mapdesc/releases/latest)
`.pk3` file and place it in your server `main`/`mainta`/`maintt` directory. If
you have other mods installed, make sure that when alphabetically sorted this
mod is placed last. Maybe add a few `z`'s just to be sure. :)

See [`global/libmef/mapdescr.scr`](./global/libmef/mapdesc.scr) for more
information.

Everything in this repository is covered by the MIT license as decribed at the
